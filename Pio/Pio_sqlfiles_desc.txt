[piomailrcpnt]
	[piouser]
	[maillist]

[piomailmsg]
	[piouser]
	[msgid]				varchar-so it's a meaningful identifier.
	[maillist]
	[subject]
	[body]
	[completed]		shows if the email message has been finalized. - value = y,n

see below create table - [piotext]
text reference data
[piouser]
[textid]
[subject]needed a subject line
[entry]
[entrydate] after doing a mysql update on all records, I discovered I need an initial DATETIME field!
[timestamp]
[status]status field of text entry		posted, hidden, pre (not finalized)

added a textgroup to piotext to account for multiple kinds of entries.
[textgroup]	for organizing repeated entries by group.  eg. george bush, bubblebobble etc.
added a type to account for various types- specifically for blog and other entries
[type] type of entry-blog, essay, consc-rsrch, etc.

see below create table [piolog] used to log url entries in pio.
added 11/06/02
[timestamp]
[ipaddr]
[revlookup]
[requrl]
[qrystring]
[browser]

see below create table [pioauth]
[piouser]
[piopass]
[pioclass]
[tmstamp]
[ipaddr]
[browser]
[piosid]

[pioclass]	  a class dictates the users file authorities.
one user must have pioadmin class.  pioadmin class has global powers. 
the pioadmin can specify other classes

see below create table [piouserdir]
[piouser]
[userdir]
[fprefix]
[fsuffix]
[fincr]

[piouserdir] is the folder the user has for storing file uploads. 
A user my have many different shared folders as determined by the admin.
Each file uploaded may be given a prefix, a suffix and an increment value.
like: [fprefix]originalname[fsuffix][fincr]originalextension

If no prefix,suffix or increment is given then the file uploaded to the
directory is originalname.originalextension

All increments are in the thousands- 0001, 0002, 0003
Files with no increment value (use a 1) will replace an existing file of the
same name.  An increment value of 0 will add that value in as the increment
and then replace it if the file already exists.  . 
eg.  originalname0000.originalextension
An increment of 1 or 3 or 5 will ad that amount to the last file with the 
same name...eg  [fprefix]originalname[fsuffix]addincrement3.originalextension

Prefix and suffix values are whatever the admin wants.  typically adding 
images from different users into a file would append the users name.  If you 
want a seperator before the increment value you could add and underscrore to 
the suffix field.

eg a record like this:. 
['user']
['/Library/WebServer/Documents/sharedimgs']
['user_']
['_']
[1]

would produce a files in the sharedimgs folder like this...up to 9999 files
with the same original name and ext (like myimage.jpg):
calvin_myimage_0001.jpg
calvin_myimage_0002.jpg

see below create table [pioclasstable]
[pioclass]
[table]
[insert]		indicates the level of authority.  F full access to table, R record access to table, N no access to table
[update]	each table has 4 types of authority.
[delete]
[select]

see below create table [pioclasspobj]
[pioclass]
[pobjid]
[page]			indicates the pobj/pages that a class is allowed to run, blank means all
[insert]			and the function that is allowed.
[update]		Record control, Full access to pobj, No access, Table access (R,F,N,T), if T, check pioclasstable.
[delete]
[select]

default values:
pioclass	blank
pobjname	blank
page			blank
insert		R
update		R
delete		R
select		F

A record level update is piouser="piouservalue" or piouser = "piouservalue", if this is not in string, it fails an authority check.
A blank class uses the default values.

only a pioadmin can modify pio files:
except user selects to piouser
and Anonymous selects to piourldict, piousertext, piotext
and user update/insert to piouser piourldict, piousertext, piotext

piourldict should be used to preprocess the piotext entries....that's an idea anyway, otherwise, it's processed at the end of piogetpage.
